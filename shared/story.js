        description: "This family-run business started in my momma's kitchen in 1997. After years of making bagels and perfecting recipes for Sunday brunch with the family, we have decided to spread the love (and cream cheese) for all of you! We would love to see you around the shop not only for breakfast, but to enjoy our serene atmostphere. You can't get the full Charlotte, NC experience without tasting Momma's Bagels. And don't even get us started on the fresh brewed coffee."
